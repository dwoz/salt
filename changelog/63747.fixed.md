Add `fileserver_interval` and `maintenance_interval` master configuration options. These options control how often to restart the FileServerUpdate and Maintenance processes. Some file server and pillar configurations are known to cause memory leaks over time. A notable example of this are configurations that use pygit2. Salt can not guarantee dependency libraries like pygit2 won't leak memory. Restarting any long running processes that use pygit2 guarantees we can keep the master's memory usage in check.
